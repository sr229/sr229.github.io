==================================================
||      You find yourself in a strange place     ||
==================================================

Fret not traveler, you didn't make a mistake. You stumbled upon an open terminal
in a corner of the internet. If you didn't mean to be here, feel free to click 
back the back button. 

If you're curious, yes, this is my portfolio website. Thank you for stumbling here.
This isn't your regular website, you're controlling a real terminal running a real
system. I provided three files about me. You can view them by typing `ls $(pwd)`. 
You can view the contents of a file by typing `cat $filename.txt`.

Happy hacking!
