There's nothing really particular interesting about me.

I am a hobbyist coder and I also design for projects that I found
interesting or for my own. I usually do most of the Open Source work
on my free time.

Currently, I'm working on some projects, some of them are listed below,
however, I'm keeping some things under wraps, which involves streaming,
and the like. Stay tuned for that!
